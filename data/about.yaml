whatido: Ever since I can remember myself, I've always been fascinated with technology and eventually grew up on the internet.<br />Over the years, I started contributing a lot to open source projects as well as create my own, from custom Android ROMs & iOS jailbreak tweaks to fully client-side E2E encrypted text bins (see {arg1}).<br />Moving forward I consciously choose to use the (limited) power I hold to ethically improve the lives of the people around me, fight climate change, protect activists and human rights and create accessible tech for everyone.
